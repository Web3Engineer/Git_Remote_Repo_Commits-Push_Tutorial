+++GitHub Remote CL Repository Commit/Push Tutorial+++
---dependencies: nodejs, gitBash, VS code ide, git---

First download/install nodejs & git to your local machine
 For the 'node.js' dependency...
   Windows: https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.17.1/node-v16.17.1-x86.msi
     Linux: $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
            $ sudo apt install nodejs
 For the 'git' dependency...
   Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
     Linux: $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
            $ sudo apt install git-all      

(On WINDOWS there are sometimes multiple version of SSH installed, It results in conflict when using git)
so open CMD in admin mode(CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER) to set your local machines enviroment vairable:
$ setx /m GIT_SSH C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe

open your terminal:
before you can access your github remote abilities you must configure your account's default identity
(USE YOUR GITHUB.COM PROFILE EMAIL & NAME)
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
tap ENTER
$ git config --global user.name "USER_NAME"
tap ENTER
to make sure you have your default ID properly set run this:
$ git config --list
$ ""user.name=USER_NAME
    user.email=YOUR_EMAIL@example.com""

now lets set your GitHub profile to accept your remote commands(use your github email):
to do this we Generate a RSA SSH key pair, github prefers the "Ed25519 algorithm"
open your terminal:
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"
OR: For using rsa for systems that don't support Ed25519:
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C “YOUR_EMAIL@example.com”
$ ""Generating public/private rsa key pair.""
$ ""Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa):""
just tap ENTER on your keybourd so it saves to the default save location printed

$ ""Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):""
enter your passphrase, then press ENTER
$ ""Enter same passphrase again:""
enter your passphrase again, then press ENTER

$ ""Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa.""
$ ""Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.""
$ ""The key fingerprint is:""
$ ""SHA256:6hOX00000Cqt17if0000000000hK6SnGk3O40000YK0 YOUR_EMAIL@example.com""

now navigate to the saved file location (C:\Users\USER_NAME/.ssh/~) and open your "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" with notepad
copy the raw (RSA or ed25519) (PUBLIC KEY!) SSH key text inside the SSH file ending in '.pub', this stands for 'public'
navigate to your github profile online and open "settings", then "SSH & GPG keys" **NOTE: Make sure the "Key Type" option is set to "Authentication Key"! NOT "Signing Key"!**
"add new SSH key" paste your copied SSH key inside and save

now open up your terminal to authenticate your SSH connection from your local machine to your GitHub profile:
$ ssh -T git@github.com
successful authentication prints the below statement
$ ""Hi YOUR_EMAIL! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.""
if you get an error please refer to this artical: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection

create a new Repository folder named "NewRepo"
but leave it empty, that just means dont upload or create any files yet, we will do that via the CL interface
copy the SSH URL and save it to a text file: "git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_NAME/NewRepo.git"

navigate to your desktop:
create a directory folder on your desktop called 'localFolder'
navigate to VS code:
open it in VS Code (or point to existing folder)
inside this folder create/insert all files to be uploaded on your GitHub, ex: 'indexExample.js'

open your terminal:
Change Directory(cd) to your new folder
$ cd /Desktop/localFolder

initialize git(git init) with a branch(-b) named 'master'
$ ~\localFolder> git init -b master
$ ""Initialized empty Git repository in ~/Desktop/localFolder/.git/""

go back to your terminal to configure your remote github origin point:
$ ~\localFolder> git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_NAME/NewRepo.git

to verify that our origin point is correct run:
$ ~\localFolder> git remote -v
$ """"origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_NAME/NewRepo.git (fetch)
$     origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE_NAME/NewRepo.git (push)""""

lets test the empty Initialized repo:
$ ~\localFolder> git status
$ """"On branch master
$     No commits yet
$     Untracked files:
$         indexExample.js   
$     nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)""""

now that we have git pointed to your file lets stage the commit:
$ ~\localFolder> git add indexExample.js  **NOTE: You can use the dot "." symbol to grab all the files in your localFolder folder.**

now lets test our staged commit:
$ ~\localFolder> git status
$ """"On branch master
$     No commits yet
$     Changes to be committed:
$     new file: indexExample.js""""
**notice that our indexExample.js file is now prepended with 'new file:'

after your successful file staging you are ready to commit(git commit) to branch 'master'(-m) with the arbitrary comment "my first commit":
$ ~\localFolder> git commit -m "my first commit"
$ """"[master (root-commit) 55fe556] my first commit
$     2 files changed, 28 insertions(+)
$     create mode 100644 indexExample.js""""

test the file commit:
$ ~\localFolder> git log
$ """"commit 55fe55600000d1980f7000008ec8a61eae900000 (HEAD -> master)
      Author: USER_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL@example.com>
      Date:   Sat Sep 7 07:07:07 2022 -0700
      my first commit""""


lets push the configured files to your github profile remotely now:
$ ~\localFolder> git push origin master
$ """"Enter passphrase for key '/c/Users/USER_NAME/.ssh/id_rsa':""""

type your passphrase then tap ENTER

$ """"Enumerating objects: 5, done.

Now go refresh your GitHub profile page and you will see your new repo!!!

Congratulations!!! 🗺️ 🪂
